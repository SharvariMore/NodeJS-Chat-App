# NodeJS-Chat-App
Developed a real time chat application by using React at the frontend for interactive UI and NodeJS at the backend for connectivity. The chat application has various features like single chat or group chat, user authentication through username and password, creating a new user. It also allows to send a picture alongside the text to the next user.
